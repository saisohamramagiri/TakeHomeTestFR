# TakeHomeTestFR

I have completed most of the prompts within the .ipynb notebook available in this repository. 

In order to address the first part of the exercise, which involved converting unstructured JSON files into structured data, I have attached a screenshot of the newly created structured Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. This diagram provides a visual representation of the data organization. Additionally, I have prepared a pdf file named Stakeholder Email.pdf, which contains the email communication sent to the respective stakeholders, ensuring efficient and effective information sharing.

I have also attached a pdf file consisting of the required SQL Queries for the second part of the Assessment. This dealt with various answers to the predetermined questions given by a business stakeholder

The Python Notebook also has links to the first, and second parts of this Exercise.

Please feel free to take a look at the Python notebook, ER Diagram, and Stakeholder Email files for additional insights and details.

# TakeHomeTestFR

I have completed the majority of the prompts within the .ipynb notebook available in this repository. 

In order to address the first part of the exercise, which involved converting unstructured JSON files into structured data, I have attached a screenshot of the newly created structured Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. This diagram provides a visual representation of the data organization. Additionally, I have prepared a pdf file named Stakeholder Email.pdf, which contains the email communication sent to the respective stakeholders, ensuring efficient and effective information sharing.

Please feel free to review the Python notebook, ER Diagram, Stakeholder Email files for further insights and details.
